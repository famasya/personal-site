My primary role has been to transition our project-based system into SaaS products. Today, our platform serves millions of patients nationwide.

      I hold a Master's degree in Informatics from ITS Surabaya, Indonesia, which has equipped me with a strong theoretical foundation and practical skills in the field. Aligned with my personal mission, I pioneered the development of the first  <Link to='https://huggingface.co/abid/indonesia-bioner' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">biomedical Named Entity Recognition in Bahasa Indonesia</Link> capable of recognizing biomedical entities in freetext.
